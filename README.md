# bydesigns-db

> DB Management System with separated process and storage layer. Built on Rust, and compatible with PostgreSQL.

**Status: design / specification stage.** This repository currently holds the development specifications; the Rust engine implementation follows the roadmap below.

## What this is

`bydesigns-db` is an OLTP database engine that is, at the same time:

- **Embeddable** — links in-process as a library, at function-call latency (SQLite-style), and
- **Storage-disaggregated** — durable state lives on object storage (S3 / Cloudflare R2 / MinIO), so compute is stateless.

These usually pull in opposite directions. The resolution is to keep the engine a **library** and make its **storage backend pluggable**, pointing the seam at the network instead of a local file — rather than putting a server at the boundary. The *same* engine then runs embedded (via FFI) **or** as a **PostgreSQL wire-compatible server**; the storage choice is configuration, not a rebuild.

Headline properties: **scale-to-zero**, **true embeddability**, and **instant branching** (copy-on-write over LSN-versioned immutable layers).

## Architecture at a glance

- **Engine (Rust library)** — SQL parser → planner → executor, MVCC (snapshot isolation via LSN-stamped versions), WAL generation, and a local page cache. Ships as `cdylib` + `staticlib` with a stable C ABI (`engine.h`), plus an `engine-server` binary.
- **Pluggable `Storage` trait** — the central seam. Two backends: `LocalFileStorage` (pure embedded, zero network) and `ObjectStorage` (disaggregated).
- **Object-storage backend** — an LSM page store (versioned by LSN) plus an ordered commit log whose durability bottoms out on **S3 conditional writes (compare-and-swap)** — atomic ordered appends and single-writer fencing without a separate consensus cluster.
- **Interfaces** — embedded via `bun:ffi` / NAPI; server via the **Postgres wire protocol**, so existing tooling (PostgREST, `Bun.sql`, standard `psql`/pg drivers) connects unchanged.

## Roadmap

1. **Embedded library first** — `bun:ffi` + `LocalFileStorage`. Fastest path to a working demo, zero infra.
2. **Add `ObjectStorage`** — LSM-on-S3 page store + S3-CAS commit log → disaggregated + scale-to-zero, still embedded.
3. **Add `engine-server` + Postgres wire protocol** — remote/server mode for multi-client and tools that expect Postgres.
4. **Add the controller** — idle stop + branch-on-LSN → scale-to-zero and instant clones.
