//! The wire surface this server answers used to live implicitly in the protocol
//! enum and the `introspect` classifier. This module makes it **explicit and
//! reviewable**: a capability matrix — every protocol message and every
//! connect-time catalog/introspection query the real clients (`Bun.sql`,
//! PostgREST 14.x, `pgbench`) issue, each tagged answered / reflected / stubbed /
//! errored — plus the one classifier that turns an *un*-answered system-catalog

//! syntax error from the engine.
//!
//! It is wire-surface only (spec 07 non-goal: no engine-core or storage change).
//! The matrix is enumerated **empirically** — from SQL captured by running the
//! clients against the listener (`TWILL_LOG_SQL`), not from reading the spec —
//! and frozen by [`crate::tests`]-adjacent conformance tests
//! (`crates/server/tests/pgwire_subset.rs`).
